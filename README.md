# Welcome! ☁🌡

This is my little weather app I built in typescript

## Instructions 
- Clone down the repo
- Open your terminal
- Run: <code>cd weatherApp</code> then <code>npm install</code> then <code>npm run dev</code>.

This should then open a http://localhost:5173/ which you can open up in your browser.

Now enter your city to find out what the weather is looking like.

## Thanks! 🖐👍
Have fun and thank you for visiting!
